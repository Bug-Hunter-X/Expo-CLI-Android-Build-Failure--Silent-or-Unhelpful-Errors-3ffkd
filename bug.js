This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves issues with the Android SDK or build tools. The exact error message might vary, but it usually indicates problems with the environment setup, missing dependencies, or incompatibility between Expo's requirements and your local configuration.  A common symptom is a build process that fails silently or produces unhelpful error messages.
