The solution involves a systematic approach to troubleshooting the Android build process.  First, verify the Android SDK path is correctly configured within the Expo CLI's environment.  Check if all necessary Android build tools and dependencies are installed. Then, perform a clean build by deleting the build cache or manually cleaning the project's output directories.  Finally, review the logs carefully, paying attention to any warnings or errors, even those that may seem unrelated.  If the problem persists, ensure the Expo CLI and related packages are updated to their latest versions.
